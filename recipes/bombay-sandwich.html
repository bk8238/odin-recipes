    <li>Green Chutney - Follow <a href="../recipes/cilantro-chutney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this recipe</a> to know how to make it</li>

    <li>1 onion - peeled and thin rounded circles</li>
    <li>Salt, Chat masala, cumin seed powder and black pepper powder - as per taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps: Let's get to chase</h4>
<p>It's very easy, no rocket science. As pre-prep, cut off the sides of the bread so that only the soft white center remains and hardened backed sides are removed. This is not necessary, so you can skip if you don't feel like.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Step 1: Apply generous amount of butter on both slices of bread. Add some <a href="../recipes/cilantro-chutney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green chutney</a> on the bread slices. So yes, first the butter then the chutney. Now, let's go on to step 2.Don't let that bread soak in that chutney for a long time else it will go soggy and trust me a soggy sandwich doesn't taste good.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Let's add our veggies. Now let's lay these potato slices on one of the bread. Sprinkle some salt and black pepper. Let's add some Onion, tomato and cucumbers. Yes, you need to make it like a stack of veggies. First goes the potato. Over it goes the onions, followed by tomato and cucumbers.</li>
    <li>Final Step: Let's add some chat masala, cumin seed powder and sprinkle some salt. Cover it with the other slice and make one horizonal cut and a vertical cut. This should give you 4 small bite sized pieces.</li>
</ol>

<p>Voila! It's ready. Garnish your sandwich with dots of tomato ketchup and some <a href="../recipes/cilantro-chutney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green chutney</a> on the bread slices. Serve immediately.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
