<h4>Steps - How to actually cook it?</h4>
<p>It's as easy as eating cereals with milk.. no I'm kidding, the only other thing that's as simple as cereals and milk is cereals and milk. But trust me, it's easier than you think. Don't waste your hard earned money on that Indian Restaurant. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large saucepan on medium flame (c'mon use whatever you got, don't be a baby). Add some oil and butter (yes, both. I never said this going to be a diet friendly recipe). Heat it for 10 seconds and add cumin seeds, let it crackle and then add those finely chopped onions. Cook onions until golden brown (I said golden brown not charcoal black.. be careful masterchef!). Add some goodness of finely chopped garlic and ginger (or use the paste). That's what will give that blissful aroma. Let it all cook slightly for 30 seconds. Don't burn it.. please.</li></br>
        <li>Let's add in that tomato paste now. Let it blend with onions, garlic and ginger. Cook for 4-5 minutes and add your chicken chunks and all remaining spices (don't forget the salt as per your taste). Cook until everything is thoroughly cooked, should take about 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <p>Pro Tip: Use less salt, we can always fix it later..</p>
        <li>Add heavy cream and let it simmer for 10 more minutes. Keep stirring that amazing butter chicken. Voila! Your butter chicken is ready. </li>
        <p>Serve it hot over some steamed rice or naan bread.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
    </ol>
